Hi Replit Team 👋,

My project Kontrib (Group Financial Management App) is now fully functional on Replit —
including registration, WhatsApp OTP verification, group joining, and admin payment approval.

I’d like to deploy this same project on Render.com for production scalability,
but I also want to keep it working exactly as it does now on Replit.

So please help make the project Render-compatible while ensuring the current Replit setup remains intact.

Here’s what I’m requesting specifically 👇


---

⚙ Compatibility Requirements

1️⃣ Port Configuration
Please make sure the server listens dynamically using:

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(Server running on ${PORT}));

→ So it works both on Replit and Render.

2️⃣ Build & Start Scripts
Ensure package.json includes these scripts (for Render build compatibility):

"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc",
  "start": "node dist/index.js"
}

3️⃣ Frontend Static Serving (for production)
Make Express serve the built Vite frontend:

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/dist')));
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../client/dist/index.html'));
});

4️⃣ Environment Variables
Keep all environment variables exactly as they are now —
I will copy the same secrets (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, WHATSAPP_TOKEN, etc.)
to Render’s Environment Variables panel later.

5️⃣ No Breaking Changes
Please ensure the project continues working on Replit exactly as it currently does.
I plan to download the updated version (as ZIP) and deploy it to Render,
while still running it in my Replit workspace for testing and development.

✅ Goal

Make the project compatible with Render’s deployment environment (Node + PostgreSQL),
but do not change or remove anything that affects Replit’s current behavior.

Once it’s ready, I’ll download the compatible build and deploy it to Render using:

Build command: npm run build

Start command: npm run start


Thank you so much for helping me with this setup! 🙏
