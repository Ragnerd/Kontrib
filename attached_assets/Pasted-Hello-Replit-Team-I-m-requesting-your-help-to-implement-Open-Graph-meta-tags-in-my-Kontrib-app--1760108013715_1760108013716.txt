Hello Replit Team, 👋

I’m requesting your help to implement Open Graph meta tags in my Kontrib app (client/index.html) to fix the WhatsApp link preview issue.

Currently, when I share my deployed link —
👉 https://kontrib.replit.app
WhatsApp does not display any link preview card (title, description, or image).

After checking your earlier analysis, the root cause is confirmed:
The <head> section in client/index.html doesn’t include any Open Graph meta tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url, etc.).


---

⚙ Requested Implementation

Please add the following meta tags in the <head> section of client/index.html:

<!-- Open Graph Meta Tags for WhatsApp/Facebook -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Kontrib - Group Financial Contributions" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Manage group financial contributions in Nigeria. Join groups, make payments, and track contributions with WhatsApp OTP verification." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://kontrib.replit.app/og-image.png" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://kontrib.replit.app" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />

<!-- Twitter Card Meta Tags (optional but recommended) -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Kontrib - Group Financial Contributions" />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Manage group financial contributions in Nigeria. Join groups, make payments, and track contributions with WhatsApp OTP verification." />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://kontrib.replit.app/og-image.png" />

Additionally, please ensure that the og:image file (og-image.png) is placed under client/public/
and that it can be accessed via the URL:
https://kontrib.replit.app/og-image.png

⚠ Important

Please only implement this meta tag section —
do not modify or touch any other parts of the project or codebase.
Everything else in the app (WhatsApp OTP, payments, admin panel, etc.) is already working perfectly.

Once implemented, I’ll redeploy and verify that the WhatsApp link preview (link card) is generated correctly.

Thank you very much for your assistance! 🙏
