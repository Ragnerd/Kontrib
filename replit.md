## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React 18 with TypeScript and Vite, leveraging Shadcn/UI (based on Radix UI) and Tailwind CSS. It features a custom Nigerian-themed color palette and a mobile-first design, including dynamic Open Graph meta tags for social sharing.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: Utilizes React Query for state management, Wouter for routing, and React Hook Form with Zod for form validation. Client-side authentication is handled via `localStorage`.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express.js, featuring Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and Zod for shared validation schemas.
- **Authentication**: SMS-based OTP-only authentication system with role-based access control (Admin/Member) and global phone number validation.
- **Payment Processing**: Members upload proof of payment for admin approval; the system tracks transactions, progress, and payment history.

### Feature Specifications
- **Group Management**: Admins can create groups with custom URLs, generate registration links, and manage group statuses.
- **Hierarchical Project Management**: Financial goals, target amounts, and deadlines are managed at the project level within groups.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Generates professional sharing messages and dynamic Open Graph meta tags.
- **Dashboard System**: Separate dashboards for Admins (group management, analytics) and Members (contributions, payment history).
- **Role-Based Navigation**: Navigation menus adapt based on user roles.

### System Design Choices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for a relational schema (Users, Groups, Members, Contributions, OTPs).
- **Modularity**: Designed for scalability and maintainability of frontend and backend components.
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports development and production environments using environment variables.
